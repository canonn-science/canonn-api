# Reporting Hub

This application is an `ASP.NET Razor Pages` project.

It is a server-rendered UI for reporting locations to the Canonn API.

## Build & Troubleshooting

The Build _should_ work out of the box.
If you run the project but see something extremely unstyled, please follow these steps:

  1. Make sure Node is installed
  2. Run `npm install`
  3. Run `npm run build`

This should process the _.sass_ files in the `wwwroot` directory and create the required _.css_ files.
